## Hello there!

I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Economics at <a href="https://economia.udp.cl/"> Universidad Diego Portales</a>, and a Senior Researcher at the <a href="https://ocec.udp.cl/"> Observatory of the Economic Context</a>.

My primary research interest lies at the intersection of Macroeconomics and Labor Economics. I am also interested in Social Networks and Survey Methodology.

Before joining Universidad Diego Portales, I completed a Ph.D. in Economics at the <a href="https://economics.ed.ac.uk/"> University of Edinburgh</a>, and I was a Research Associate at <a href="https://leas.uai.cl/"> Laboratory of Surveys and Social Analysis</a> (LEAS) hosted by Universidad Adolfo Ibañez.
