## Hello there!

I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Economics at <a href="https://economia.udp.cl/"> Universidad Diego Portales</a> and a Ph.D. Candidate at the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/economics"> University of Edinburgh</a>. I am also a Research Associate at the <a href="https://leas.uai.cl/">Laboratory of Surveys and Social Analysis</a> (LEAS) hosted by Universidad Adolfo Ibañez.

My primary research interest lies at the intersection of Macroeconomics and Labor Economics. I am also interested in Social Networks.

Before starting my studies at the University of Edinburgh, I completed an M.Res. in Economics at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/economics/ucl-department-economics"> University College London</a>, and I was a Research Assistant for two years at <a href="https://www.cepchile.cl/"> Centro de Estudios Públicos</a>.
