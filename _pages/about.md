## Hello there!

I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/economics"> University of Edinburgh</a>. I am also a Research Associate at the <a href="https://leas.uai.cl/">Laboratory of Surveys and Social Analysis</a> (LEAS) hosted by Universidad Adolfo Ibañez.

My main research interest lies in the intersection between Macroeconomics and Labor Economics. I am also interested in Social Networks.

Before starting my studies at the University of Edinburgh, I completed a M.Res. in Economics at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/economics/ucl-department-economics"> University College London</a>, and I was Research Assistant for two years at <a href="https://www.cepchile.cl/"> Centro de Estudios Públicos</a>.

<b> I will be on the 2024-25 Job Market. <b>
