      * Abstract: This paper studies the evolution of labor informality in Chile, with a twofold contribution. First, since the country only has an official measure of informality from 2017, I propose a way of measuring informality in which the formal share of employment is consistent with administrative records. Then, I generate a series of informality from 1990 to 2020, which is surprisingly stable. This is counter-intuitive since Chile has experienced a significant increase in tertiary education in the last three decades, a component often linked to informality reduction. Second, I adapt a search and matching model that explains the decrease in labor informality in Brazil to the Chilean case, and I estimate it using data from 2006-2017. The model is focused on the general equilibrium effects that affect informality when the skill composition of the workforce changes. I find that increases in the real minimum wage and the decrease in the TFP offset the impact of rising tertiary education, contributing to the observed stability in informality levels. The above shed light on the differences between the Brazilian and Chilean economies, highlighting potential diminishing returns in the composition effects mentioned. Lastly, I delve into the broader implications of these findings, with a focus on pertinent policies that could be implemented to alleviate informality in the country.

   * Abstract: This paper explores the implications of tertiary education expansion in Chile from 2010 to 2019, mainly focusing on how large firms substitute workers with varying qualifications and experience. Despite a significant increase in the share of tertiary-educated workers, reaching 45 percent, there is no substantial decline in the wage premium associated with college-educated workers. Regarding occupations, we found a notable mismatch between educational attainment and job requirements, where most workers with higher vocational education find themselves overqualified, leading to a potential displacement of those workers by their college-educated counterparts. Then, we introduce a novel model estimated through administrative
data, and we found close-to-perfect substitutability between workers with higher vocational and college education. Lastly, examining study plans at the technical, professional, and college levels reveals a relevant overlap, rationalizing the substitution between different educational levels. Finally, we emphasize the need for policymakers to differentiate programs at each educational level since this would lead to a more effective integration of workers with tertiary education in the labor market.

   * Presented at:
     - *WAPOR Conference* (2023) [**Alexis de Tocqueville Award**]

   * Abstract: This paper explores the relationship between social ties across socioeconomic groups and populism at the individual-level across the globe, using data from the ISSP 2017 survey on Social Networks and Resources and the 2021 Chilean sample of the CNEP survey. Specifically, we investigate how the socioeconomic composition of individuals' networks relates to their likelihood of voting for populist candidates and their attitudes towards populism. We rely on a position generator questionnaire based on occupational categories available both for ISSP and CNEP, allowing us to measure the socioeconomic composition of respondents' interpersonal networks. We measure populist voting preferences in ISSP by matching individuals' voting choice in the last election with several secondary classifications of party and candidate populism, and in CNEP by relying on the populist attitudes scale developed by Rovira and colleagues (2012). Across our different measures and relying on several estimation strategies, we show that the average socioeconomic status of an individual's interpersonal network has a consistently negative and significant association with populist preferences: having higher status ties correlates with lower acceptance of populist politics. Moreover, we also show that the association between socioeconomic status and populist preferences is mediated by interpersonal network’s status. Taken together, our evidence supports de Tocqueville's and Kornhauser's claims regarding the role of interpersonal interactions in buffering citizens from the allures of populism.
